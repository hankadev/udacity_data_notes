# Standardizing
We use __relative frequency histogram__ so we can determine what proportion of people are between a range.

In graph below the proportion of people having 170 - 210 Facebook friends is __0.46__.

__Z__ = number of standard deviations away from the mean.

__Z-score__ is a way to standardize the distribution. We calculate is as the value minus the mean divided by the standard deviation.

__Standard normal distribution__: by calculation the z-score for each value, we shift the normal distribution, so the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1.
