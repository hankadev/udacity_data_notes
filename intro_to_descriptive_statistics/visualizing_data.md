# Visualizing data
__Frequency table__ shows the absolute numbers for each item (here numbers of students from each country).

__Relative frequency__ shows the proportion of students from each country. All proportions are greater or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1. For any frequency table the relative frequencies should add to 1. \
example: 2 students for Canada, total 50 students, so the proportion is 2/50 = 0.04 \
Another way to show proportion are the percentages (proportion * 100).

| County      | Frequency | Proportion | Percent   |
| :---------- | :---------| :--------- | :-------- |
| Canada      | 2         | 0.04       | 4 %       |
| China       | 12        | 0.24       | 24 %      |
| England     | 2         | 0.04       | 4 %       |
| Germany     | 3         | 0.06       | 6 %       |
| India       | 8         | 0.16       | 16 %      |
| Japan       | 8         | 0.16       | 16 %      |
| Mexico      | 3         | 0.06       | 6 %       |
| Pakistan    | 1         | 0.02       | 2 %       |
| Sweden      | 1         | 0.02       | 2 %       |
| US          | 10        | 0.20       | 20 %      |

Frequency table with intervals (interval = bin = bucket), the bin size is 20.

| Age         | Frequency  |
| :---------- | :----------|
| 0 - 19      | 19         |
| 20 - 39     | 21         |
| 40 - 59     | 5          |
| 60 - 79     | 5          |

__Histogram__ is a type of graph which shows the frequency of data items in successive numerical intervals of equal size. The data on x-axis are numerical (quantitative) - for example the age.

__Positively skewed distribution__ means that histogram has most of the data on the left side. When there are most of the data on the right side, the histogram has __negatively skewed distribution__. When the data of histogram are symmetrical, it has __normal distribution__.

__Bar graph__ shows data with distinct categories (there are no intervals). The order of columns does not matter (we can switch them). The data on x-axis are categorical (qualitative) - for example the countries.
