# Normal Distribution
__Probability density function (PDF)__ is the curve of theoretical normal distribution where the area under the curve is 1 (because it models the relative frequencies of the distribution of data in terms of proportions). We model this theoretical curve in standardizing lesson.

x-axis is a __horizontal asymptote__ => the curve will never touch it (that means that we can have a value anywhere on the left or right side - distant from the mean, but the probability is very small)

We can use calculus to find the area under the curve between any two values. We can also use the __Z-table__ to find the proportion for any z-score in standardized normal distribution.
