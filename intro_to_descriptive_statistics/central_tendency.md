# Central Tendency
When we have histogram with salaries, which number should we use to accurately represents the typical salary?
* __mode (value with the highest frequency)__
* __median (value in the middle)__
* __mean (average value)__

### Mode
Mode is the value (range of values) at which the frequency is the highest. The dataset might have zero, one or more modes.

Not all values in a dataset influence the mode and if we have more samples, each sample might have different mode. So we can use mode to describe the dataset, but not the population.

__Uniform distribution__ has all the frequencies more or less same, therefore there is no mode.

### Mean (x-bar)
To calculate mean, we need to sum all the values (sum) and divide them by the total number of values (count) of the values.

mean = sum / count
