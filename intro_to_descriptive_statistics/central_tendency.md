# Central Tendency
When we have histogram with salaries, which number should we use to accurately represents the typical salary?
* __mode (value with the highest frequency)__
* __median (value in the middle)__
* __mean (average value)__

### Mode
Mode is the value (range of values) at which the frequency is the highest. The dataset might have zero, one or more modes.

* not all values in a dataset influence the mode
* if we have more samples, each sample might have different mode
* we can use mode to describe the dataset, but not the population
* there is no formula for calculation of the mode

__Uniform distribution__ has all the frequencies more or less same, therefore there is no mode.

### Mean (x-bar)
To calculate mean, we need to sum all the values (sum) and divide them by the total number of values (count) of the values: __mean = sum / count__

Properties of the mean:
* all scores in the distribution affect the mean
* it can be described with a formula
* many samples from the same population will have similar means
* the mean of a sample cam be used to make inferences about the population it came from
* the mean will change if we add an extreme value to the dataset

The mean is misleading, if the dataset contains __outliers__ (values that are unexpectedly different from the other observed values). Outliers creates the skewed distribution.

### Median
Value in the middle of the data (data must be ordered from smallest to largest or from largest to smallest). If the dataset has even number of values, then we take the two in the middle an their average is the median.

__Robust__ is the tendency of the median meaning that the median is not strongly affected by the outliers. So median is good measure for skewed distributions.
