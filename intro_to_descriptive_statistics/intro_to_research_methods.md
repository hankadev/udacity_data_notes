# Intro to Research Methods

__Constructs__ are very difficult to define and measure and everyone may have his own definition and way of measuring. Examples: happiness, intelligence, effort.

__Operational definitions__ allow us measure the constructs. There may be more than one possible operational definition for one construct. For example effort can be measure by minutes spend doing an assignment or by the grades.

__Population parameters (mu)__ are values that describe the entire population. __Sample statistics (x-bar)__ are values that describe our sample; we use statistics to estimate the population parameters. Estimates are our best guesses for the population parameters. __Sampling error__ is the difference between these two.

__Random sample__ means that each subject has the equal change to being selected and the sample is more likely to approximate the population.

__Convenience sample__ (grab sample, accidental sample, or opportunity sample) is taken from a group of people easy to contact or to reach.

__Independent variable (predictor variable)__ on axis X.\
__Dependent variable (outcome)__ on axis Y. \
We can predict the outcome using the independent variables, because we can see the trend in the graph.\
In an experiment, the researcher manipulates the independent variable, measures changes in the dependent variable and seeks to control the lurking variables.

__Correlation does not prove causation!__ Lurking (extraneous) variables can falsely identify a strong relationship between variables.

__Golden Arches Theory__ (Thomas Friedman): no two countries with a McDonald's have ever gone to war since opening the McDonald's.

__show relationship__ => observational studies survey \
__show causation__ => controlled experiment

__Benefits of surveys__
* easy way to get info on population
* relatively inexpensive
* can be conducted remotely
* anyone can access and analyze data

__Downsides of surveys__
* untruthful responses
* biased responses
* respondents not understanding the question (_response bias_)
* respondents refusing to answer (_non-response bias_)

__Controlled experiments__
* random sample
* comparison group (e.g. group taking placebo)
* blinding - people do not know which group they are in
* double blinding - researchers do not know who is in which group and they are not biased
