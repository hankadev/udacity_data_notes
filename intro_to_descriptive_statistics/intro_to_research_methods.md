#Intro to Research Methods

__Constructs__ are very difficult to define and measure and everyone may have his own definition and way of measuring. Examples: happiness, intelligence, effort.

__Operational definitions__ allow us measure the constructs. There may be more than one possible operational definition for one construct. For example effort can be measure by minutes spend doing an assignment or by the grades.

__Population parameters (mu)__ are values that describe the entire population. __Sample statistics (x-bar)__ are values that describe our sample; we use statistics to estimate the population parameters. Estimates are our best guesses for the population parameters. __Sampling error__ is the difference between these two.

__Random sample__ means that each subject has the equal change to being selected and the sample is more likely to approximate the population.

__Independent variable (predictor variable)__ on axis X.\
__Dependent variable (outcome)__ on axis Y. \
We can predict the outcome using the independent variables, because we can see the trend in the graph.

__Correlation does not prove causation!__ Lurking (extraneous) variables can falsely identify a strong relationship between variables.
