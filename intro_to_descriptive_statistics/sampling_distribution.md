# Sampling Distribution
To compare a sample in a population to other samples in the same population we need to find the mean of this sample, find the mean of the other samples in this population and compare them.

###  Central Limit Theorem
Ratio of population standard deviation to standard deviation of a distribution of sample means (sampling distribution) is equal to the square root of sample size.... so the __sampling distribution (SE standard error)__ is equal to the population standard deviation divided by the the square root of sample size.

As the sample size increases:
* the standard error decreases
* the shape of the sampling distribution gets skinnier
